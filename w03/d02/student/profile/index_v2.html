She joined the Portland, Oregon chapter in 2011, under the leadership of the late Robert K. Ingram, and later served as President. Ms. Aykes is an alumna of Rutgers University-Newark, with a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry. In addition to her commitment to service and empowerment in the Movement, she was most recently employed by Oregon Health & Science University's department of Behavioral Neuroscience. The outcome of her latest project on the ADHD population was recently featured in the Huffington Post. Her duties also included serving as co-director of the Youth Engaged in Science (YES!)
